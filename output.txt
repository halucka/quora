0 Is it possible to study both economics and math at Cambridge University?1 2 There’s a full list of undergraduate subjects here:Undergraduate StudyYou’ll notice that, under Economics, it says ‘Mathematics’ but, under Mathematics, it doesn’t say ‘Economics’.I think - and I’m not the expert - that means you can take Maths modules in your Economics degree if you want to, but you still end up with an Economics degree, but you can’t take Economics modules as part of your Maths degree.But I might be wrong.3 Out of Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge: Which university has the best math program? (both undergraduate and graduate level)4 How does it feel to study at Cambridge University?5 Who can study at Cambridge University?6 Is it possible to graduate in both economics and philosophy from the University of Cambridge?7 Can I study Parapsychology in Cambridge University?8 Quora User is wrong about this.It is possible to study both maths and economics as an undergraduate at Cambridge.From Undergraduate Study at Cambridge:It's possible to combine Economics with another subject, for example by taking one or two years of Economics and then transferring to another subject such as Law or Management Studies. You can also study another subject such as Mathematics for one year before transferring to Part IIA Economics. Several students make such changes each year.9 I believe that the Cambridge maths degree is one of the oldest degree courses and qualifications in the world. As such they’re a bit snobbish about it and have a few odd traditions. When I got my degree (I don’t know if this is still the case), they stubbornly still refused to award the standard 1st, 2:1, 2:2 and 3rd class degrees that every other degree in Cambridge and elsewhere in England gives out, but have just one second class - thus I bear the fine title of a ‘junior wrangler’, which was announced in an age-old ceremony by some bloke shouting names out on a platform.(Like all Oxbridge degrees, I was also entitled to pay a fiver a few years later and get it automatically upgraded to an MA. Cheeky buggers)If it’s true what Jonathan Smith says below, that you can do Economics and Maths but not Maths and Economics, it would fit perfectly into that kind of exceptionalism so it wouldn’t surprise me at all!Don’t get me wrong, incidentally, I love mad traditions. But that doesn’t make them any less silly.10 What is it like to study literature at Cambridge University?11 What is the hardest math class at Cambridge University?12 What distinguishes Cambridge University from Oxford University?13 Is it possible study Math in university with basics?14 What is it like to study economics at the University of Cambridge?15 How do Cambridge students study?16 How is Cambridge University?17 What is the best way to learn economics?18 How should I study math?19 What is it like to study Engineering at Cambridge University?20 Out of Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge: Which university has the best math program?
